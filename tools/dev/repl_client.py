"""DEV: drive the in-game WoT REPL (the wgmod_debug mod) from the host PC.

The debug mod (tools/dev/mod_wgmod_debug.py, packaged as com.drizzer14.wgmod_debug.wotmod)
runs a TCP REPL on 127.0.0.1:2223 inside the live client. This client sends one
command per line and reads until the server's __WGEND__ sentinel.

  python tools/dev/repl_client.py "<python expr/stmt>"     # single command
  python tools/dev/repl_client.py --file cmds.txt          # one command per line

Notes:
- Each connection is a fresh REPL namespace (state shared only WITHIN one run),
  so put interdependent commands in one --file.
- Multi-line defs/with-blocks do NOT work line-by-line: write them to a .py file
  and run `execfile(r'<abs path>')` (Python 2 builtin) as a single command.
- Run under Python 3 (host). The game side is Python 2.7.
