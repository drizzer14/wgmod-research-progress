"""Engine-free data types shared by the domain layer. 2/3 compatible.

EU 2.3 model (verified against the decompiled client source):
the selected vehicle's research is a single XP axis with two phases — tech-tree
research (modules + next vehicles, Tier XI included as an ordinary unlock), then
Field Modifications ("upgrades") once the vehicle is fully researched (elite).

Once a vehicle is elite and its field mods are done, EU 2.3 still has the global
**Elite Levels** system (internal codename "prestige", WG update 1.22.1): a
cosmetic 0..350 per-vehicle progression earned via combat XP, split into grade
bands (iron/bronze/silver/gold/enamel -> max). Certain tiers (the owner's tier XI)
additionally grant **milestone rewards** (2D styles / attachments) at specific
levels. So past COMPLETE the bar shows ELITE_REWARDS (tier-XI exclusive rewards,
while any remain) -> ELITE (the grade-band progression) -> COMPLETE (no prestige
data / fallback badge).
