"""Mode state machine for the EU 2.3 model.

Per selected vehicle:
- not elite (something left to unlock) -> TECH_TREE (modules + next vehicles).
- elite (fully researched) with remaining field-mod steps -> FIELD_MODS.
- elite + prestige + tier-exclusive rewards still to earn -> ELITE_REWARDS
  (the reward roadmap shown first).
- elite + prestige (rewards all earned / none) -> ELITE (grade-band progression).
- elite, no prestige data -> COMPLETE ("fully researched" badge fallback).

Fill is the player's spendable XP shown as two stacked segments: vehicle XP
first, then global free XP. The view treats a scale_min == scale_max range as
100% (guard divide-by-zero). The ELITE/ELITE_REWARDS modes reuse the same
scale/ticks/fill axis with a single segment (fill_free = 0).
