"""Pure resolver for the tier-XI "vehicle skill tree" upgrade. Engine-free, tested.

A tier-XI vehicle is reached by upgrading a tier-X through a branching skill tree
(post-progression with a tree id >= 10000), NOT the linear field-modification
ladder. Per the owner's directive the bar shows this as a COUNT readout -- the
tree is non-linear, so an XP axis is meaningless. Every tier-XI tree has a FIXED
set of upgrades, so the axis is that node count and the fill is how many nodes are
unlocked. One tick is placed per node (evenly spaced, no per-node metadata since
ordering is non-linear); the rightmost tick flags the signature 'final' upgrade
and carries its icon. A header counter shows unlocked / total nodes.

resolve() returns a plain dict the builder maps onto ResearchProgressModel (the
same contract as elite.py), or None when this isn't a skill-tree vehicle or the
tree is already fully upgraded (so the builder falls through to ELITE / COMPLETE).
