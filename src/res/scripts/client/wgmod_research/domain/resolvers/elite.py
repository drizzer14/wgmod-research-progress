"""Pure resolvers for the Elite Levels ("prestige") system. Engine-free, tested.

Two views, both reusing the bar's scale/ticks/fill axis (so the JS renders them
with the same pct(scale_min..scale_max) math as the other modes):

- resolve_grade_band: the CURRENT complex-grade band (e.g. all of SILVER's four
  sub-grades), with one milestone tick per sub-grade and the fill running to the
  current elite level. The axis spans [band_min, band_max).
- resolve_reward_track: the tier-exclusive milestone-REWARD roadmap -- one tick
  per reward (with its img:// thumbnail + earned/next/upcoming state), the axis
  spanning [0, last reward level], fill to the current level.

Each returns a plain dict the builder maps onto ResearchProgressModel. `fill` is
the position OFFSET from scale_min (scale_min + fill == current position).
