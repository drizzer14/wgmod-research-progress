"""PC-only write-side: perform the research / field-mod unlocks the user clicks.

Counterpart to engine_adapter.py, which only READS. Each public function resolves
the currently-selected vehicle and runs WG's own research/unlock flow, then the
game's onSyncCompleted (already wired in the bridge) refreshes the bar. Everything
is guarded so a failure degrades to opening WG's native screen for that item --
never a raise back into the JS bridge, never a silent spend.

Symbols verified live in the EU 2.3 client via the dev REPL (the game's own
context-menu "Research" handler uses exactly this path):

  * Tech-tree research: ItemsActionsFactory (the module
    `gui.shared.gui_items.items_actions.factory`) .doAction(UNLOCK_ITEM, itemCD,
    UnlockProps). UnlockProps (from techtree.settings) is built from the vehicle's
    own unlock-graph row: (unlockIdx, xpCost, itemCD, required).
  * Field-mod step: the items-actions factory PURCHASE_POST_PROGRESSION_STEPS
    action -- WG's confirm-then-research flow (see unlock_field_mod). NOT
    event_dispatcher.showPostProgressionResearchDialog, which only shows the
    confirm dialog and returns the choice; it never researches.
  * Screens (tier-XI final tick, choice-pair levels, and every fallback):
    event_dispatcher.showVehPostProgressionView / showResearchView.
