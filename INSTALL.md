# Research Progress Bar — Installation Guide

A World of Tanks mod that adds a progress bar to the Garage showing the selected
vehicle's progression at a glance:

- **Tech-tree research** — modules and the next vehicle to unlock.
- **Field Modifications** — the post-progression upgrade ladder.
- **Elite Levels (prestige)** — current grade band and the tier-XI reward track.
- **Tier-XI vehicle skill-tree** — upgrade progress as a "% upgraded" readout.

It uses the game's own icons and hover tooltips, and refreshes live whenever you
switch vehicles.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Game** | World of Tanks **EU (Wargaming)** client, version **2.3.0.1**. Built and tested against this version. |
| **Dependency** | **OpenWG GameFace**. The installer sets this up for you; for a manual install you add it yourself. |

This build targets the Wargaming EU/global client (version 2.3.0.1).

---

## Install with the installer (recommended)

1. Close World of Tanks completely (exit the Game Center launcher too).
2. Run **`ResearchProgressBar-Setup-0.1.2.exe`**.
3. Confirm your World of Tanks folder when the installer shows it — the folder that
   contains `version.xml`. The installer detects it automatically in most cases.
4. The installer adds OpenWG GameFace when your client doesn't already have it, then
   installs the mod into `mods\<version>\`.
5. Start the game and go to the Garage.

To remove the mod later, use its entry in Windows **Apps & features**, or re-run the
installer. OpenWG GameFace stays in place for other mods that use it.

---

## Manual install

1. Get **OpenWG GameFace** from the official WG mod portal (**wgmods.net**) or the
   OpenWG project's GitLab releases, and install its `.wotmod` into your game's
   `mods\<version>\` folder. If you already run other GameFace mods you likely have it.
2. Open your World of Tanks folder and the version-matched mods folder inside it:

   ```
   <World of Tanks>\mods\2.3.0.1\
   ```

   The folder name matches your installed client version. After a game update the
   version changes and you move the mod into the new version folder.

3. Copy **`com.drizzer14.wgmod_0.1.2.wotmod`** into that folder.
4. Delete any older version of this mod from the same folder first.
5. Fully restart the game client: exit completely and relaunch.

The `mods\2.3.0.1\` folder then holds the OpenWG GameFace `.wotmod` and
`com.drizzer14.wgmod_0.1.2.wotmod`.

---

## Verifying it works

1. Launch the game and go to the **Garage**.
2. Select a vehicle that still has research, field modifications, or elite levels
   remaining.
3. A progress bar appears in the vehicle-parameters area, with the matching header
   icon and a Total-XP readout.
4. Hover the ticks/icons to see tooltips. Switch vehicles and the bar updates.

## Troubleshooting

**The bar doesn't show up.**
- Confirm OpenWG GameFace is installed in the same `mods\<version>\` folder.
- Confirm the `.wotmod` is in the folder matching your client version (for example
  `mods\2.3.0.1\`).
- Check that no loose copy of the mod sits under `res_mods\<version>\scripts\client\`,
  which would override the packaged mod. Keep only the `.wotmod` in `mods\<version>\`.
- Fully restart the client after installing.

**A game update stopped it from working.**
- Game updates change the version folder. Move the `.wotmod` from the old
  `mods\<old-version>\` into the new `mods\<new-version>\`. A new client version may
  also need a rebuilt mod — check for an updated release.

**Special "7×7" / event hangars.**
- Some special battle-mode hangars don't expose the panel the bar attaches to, so the
  bar won't appear there. It returns in the normal Garage.

## Uninstalling

Remove the mod through its Windows **Apps & features** entry, or delete
`com.drizzer14.wgmod_0.1.2.wotmod` from `mods\<version>\`, then restart the client.
